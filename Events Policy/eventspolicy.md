### Event Definition and Types of Events
##### Event Definition
An event shall be considered any time the Events Coordinator or his designee post sign-ups to sponsor a coordinated effort from controllers to staff specific positions for a specified amount of time.
##### Types of Events
1. Facility Events:
	 1. These events directly involve one or more facilities within the Chicago ARTCC airspace. Facility events are either drafted by vZAU, neighboring ARTCCs, or VATUSA staff.
	 2. Examples of facility events include: Friday Night Ops at Chicago, VatVenture, Home for the Holidays
2. Support Events:
	 1. These events may either directly or indirectly involve one or more facilities within the Chicago ARTCC airspace. Support events are drafted by neighboring ARTCCS, Virtual Airlines, or VATUSA staff.
	 2. Examples of support events include: Delta Virtual fly-in to Chicago, vZID hosting Friday Night Ops, Pacific Airways group flight KDEN to KDTW.

### Event Signup Process
##### Upcoming Events
1. The vZAU Events Coordinator (EC) shall post each event to the vZAU webpage as events are scheduled, minimally 14 days prior to the event, with 48 hours notice minimum. Once an event is posted, the event will be available for controllers to bid for positions.
2. If the EC is notified of an event without sufficient time to create signups and use the procedures contained in this document, he will determine an alternative signup process and publish it in the appropriate section of the vZAU forums.

##### Signup Process
1. Controllers wishing to sign up for an event shall submit a ticket via the ticketing system on the vZAU webpage. The ticket must contain the following information to be considered a valid bid:  
    - **How many shifts the controller wishes to work** (i.e. the whole event, first shift only, second shift only, etc.)
    - **A prioritized list of the top three positions the controller wishes to work**. Positions include:  
      - Chicago Center
      - Major Approach (C90)
      - Minor Approach (any minor TRACON)
      - Major Tower (ORD)
      - Minor Tower (any Minor Tower)
      - Major Ground/Delivery (ORD)
      - Minor Ground/Delivery (any minor ground/delivery)
      - Anywhere (the controller has no preference and will work any position assigned)
    - **Controllers rated to work Chicago Center (C1+) must submit "Chicago Center" as one of their top three positions**. This is designed to help fill the critical role of having a center position filled for events. 
    - **Controllers rated to work Chicago Approach (C90) must submit "Major Approach" as one of their top three postitions**. This is designed to help fill critical roles of having Chicago approach filled for events.
    - **Example Ticket:**  
      - **Shifts**: I can work the whole event
      - **Top Positions**: Major Tower, Minor Approach, Center
2. Signups will close 48 hours prior to the event deadline.
    - At that time, the EC will publish the list of controllers and their respective positions. 
    - The roster will be publish, at minimum, 24 hours prior to the event.
3. Controllers who sign up after the event signup process closes will be placed in positions on a first come, first served basis, after all signed up controllers have been placed in a position.
**Note that controllers may ONLY sign up for positions they are currently certified on. Controllers may not assume a promotion will occur before an event deadline.**

### Position Assignment Process
##### After Event Signups Have Closed:
1. The EC will verify each controller has the certified for the positions they applied for.
2. The EC, in partnership with the ATM or DATM, will place controllers in the position they deem is within the controller's experience and capabilities. 
4. The EC will publish the list of controllers and their respective positions in the appropriate section of the vZAU forums.

##### ACE Team Members:
1. Once the signups have closed and the list of controllers and positions is published, the EC will fill the remaining positions with ACE Team members if they have been requested.

##### Open Signups:
1. Only after the ACE Team members (if used) have been assigned the remaining positions, the EC will publish a list of any remaining positions in the appropriate vZAU forum.
2. Controllers may reply to the post to claim the remaining spots.
3. The remaining spots are on a first come, first served basis. I.e those who reply to the post first, receive their choice of positions.

### Shifts
##### Duration:
1. Event shifts will last from a minimum of one hour to a maximum of three hours.

##### Typical Event Durations:
1. The typical event time lasts for four hours. Minor events may be less than this, however a minimum of three hours is expected. 
    - In the case of a four hour event, two shifts of two hours each will be used.

##### Notice:
1. Events are a time when vZAU showcases its ATC services to the VATSIM community.
2. VATSIM rules prevent vZAU staff to place any requirement on any controller to commit to any specific amount of time.
3. Please use your best judgement when signing up for an event.
4. If for any reason, you think you will not hbe able to work the length of the shift, please contact the EC, or the CIC for the event), so that your time can be honored in the best way possible.
5. Controllers are **encouraged** to sign up for more than one shift.

### Position Restrictions
##### Reservation of Position:
1. Controllers who have signed up for positions may consider their position reserved for them on the day of the event and will equal logging in to the position per the VATSIM Code of Conduct.
    - The is provided that the event was announced, signups were published, and public display and announcement were given prior to the event deadline.  

> Note that the VATSIM Code of Conduct states: Positions are occupied on a "first come" basis. If the position a controller wants to work is already occupied, then another position should be fround. From time to time, a controller who has occupied a particular position may lose his or her connection to the VATSIM network or to the Internet. If another controller takes such a position and thereafter the original controller logs back on and advises that he or she had lost their connection, the second controller should relinquish the position to the original controller.  
--- VATSIM CODE OF CONDUCT, C5

##### Certifications:
1. Controllers may only request to serve in positions they have certification to control (including any major endorsements).
2. No controller may assume that will attain a certification or endorsement prior to the event deadline. They may only sign up for the event using the certifications and and endorsements they currently possess at the time of the signup. 

##### Special Positions:
1. Occasionally, events may demand creating special ATC positions to fulfill the requirements of the event and faciltate efficient traffic flow. Susch positions may not be expressly outlined in the vZAU SOPs or positions table.
2. These special positions or procedures will remain in effect only for the duration of the event and will not be applied or enforced outside of an event setting.

### The Day of the Event
##### Position Briefing:
1. The EC will provide written position briefings to each controller at the close of signups (or as soon as practical afterwards).
    - The briefing will outline all of the procedures and strategy the controller will use to fulfill their role.
    - Any questions about the briefing document should be directed to the CIC of the event
    - In the event no specific position briefing is released, all positions are to follow the vZAU SOPs, unless otherwise directed by the CIC.
2. On the day of the event, the CIC will conduct an event briefing prior to the event.
    - The briefing will begin at least fifteen (15) minutes prior to the event.
    - All participating controllers should atten the briefing.
    - All participating controllers should review the written briefing prior to attending this meeting.
3. Briefing
    - The briefing will address any last minute nuances typical of items such as weather, dealys, requests from neighboring ARTCCs, etc. 
    - In the event the vZAU TeamSpeak serve is down or cannot be accessed, email will serve as the replacement for briefings.

##### Shifts:
1. The CIC will conduct shift briefings prior to shift changes during an event.
2. Since it is impractical to shift all positions at once, the shift changes may start either slightly before, or slightly after the official end time of the shift.

##### Position Logon/Logoff:
1. Controllers may log on to their positions at any time prior to the event deadline. However, controllers should consider that logging on to a position may inhibit their abilities to carefully listen to the briefing and thus they may miss vital information to the successful outcome of the event.
2. If a controller is already logged in to your position prior to the event deadline, you must wait until the deadline before logging on to your position.
3. If you need to relinquish your position prior to the official end of your shift, please make arrangements with the CIC as soon as possible prior to leaving so a replacement can be coordinate.

### Controller-In-Charge
##### Authority:
1. For each facility event, vZAU will specify a Controller-In-Charge (CIC)
2. The CIC will have the authority to make decisions to facilitate the successful outcome of the event.
3. In most cases, this role will be filled by the vZAU Events Coordinator, however it may be designated to another controller. The CIC will be announced in the roster and briefing.

##### Duties:
1. The CIC is responsible for drafing all event briefing materials and distributing them to the event controllers and the general vZAU public at a minimum of 24 hours prior to the event.
    - The briefing materials shall include a list of all event positions, names of controllers staffing those positions, and any pertinent information regarding the positions relating to the character of the upcoming event.
2. The CIC will host a briefing on the vZAU Teamspeak server prior to the event deadline in accordance with the Briefing policy.
    - During the briefing, the CIC will make any final decisions about the weather, runway configurations, arrivals, etc.
    - The CIC will answer any questions raised from the written briefings.
3. The CIC is responsible for filling any positions that are vital to the outcome of the event.
    - This is especially true of positions that are closing or have closed.
4. The CIC may open any postions (including splitting positions) to facilitate traffic flow and efficency during the event.
    - Positions will be offered to event controllers covering seconday positions first before offering it to standby controllers.
    - Note: Per VATSIM policy, the positions described above are first come, first served. If controllers that are leaving find their own replacements, the CIC may not remove the replacement.
5. The CIC may work a position during an event, but must be able to answer questions from other controllers quickly and effectively during the event time.
6. The CIC will hold shift briefings on the vZAU TeamSpeak server.
7. If the CIC is not the Events Coordinator, the CIC will send a summary email to the EC at the termination of the event. This email will detail the event and any difficulties encountered along the way.
8. The CIC is responsible for, and has the final say, in approving all operations for the event including the ATIS information, runways in use, departure headings, holding patterns, ground stops, arrivals in use, sequencing and spacing of traffic, etc.
    - If a controller takes issue with instructions from the CIC, the controller shall wait until the end of the event to bring up the issue with the CIC or the appropriate vZAU staff member.

### Event Cancellation Policy
##### When Events Are Cancelled:
1. Large Events: 80% of the positions for the entire event must be signed up prior to one week before the event (excluding any ACE Team requests). If the 80% rule is not met, then the ACE Team request is to be made as soon as practical. If the 80% rule has not been met within 48 hours of the event (including ACE Team requests), the event is to be cancelled.
    - **Exception: Per VATUSA DP003, any Friday Night Ops event cannot be cancelled for any reason.**
2. Small Events: At least 1 CTR, 1 APP, and 1 TWR position for each shift and the advertised airport needs to be staffed or the event is to be cancelled.
