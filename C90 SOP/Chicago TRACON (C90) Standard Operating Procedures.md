        >NOTE -- * in the above tables indicates the primary combined frequency to be connected first.
        
        1. Every controller shall utilize a primary frequency in their ATC client program for communications with aircraft. Every controller is encouraged to use voice as the primary method of communication with aircraft per VATSIM regulations. However, aircraft utilizing non-voice communications (text or receive only) will never be denied ATC services, nor will controllers executing text or receive only commands be denied the ability to control. Controllers shall use text to clarify instructions and/or when instructed by an aircraft. 
        2. Every C90 position will maintain a standard and common position ATIS. VRC’s Controller Info dialog automates many of these elements of a standard position ATIS. The position ATIS will include the following elements at minimum:
            ```
            Position
            Current ATIS Letter ID
            Active Runways 
            ```
        3. At Class D, C and B airports located within C90, Local Control shall be responsible for keeping an updated voice ATIS with all necessary information pertaining to operations its respective airport. The standard VOICE ATIS for C90 if no other controller is online, is KORD_ATIS. The secondary Voice ATIS will be KMDW_ATIS. If both of those airports have a voice ATIS currently active, it will be up to the C90 controller on whether to connect an ATIS for a C90 Class Delta airport, however it is not required to do so. The ATIS should also be recorded with the voice server as rw.liveatc.net. Sample voice ATIS templates can be found below.
            1. O’Hare Airport Information (code), (time of wx observation) Zulu, (weather sequence – wind,
            vis, precip/phenomena, clouds, temp, dewpoint, altimeter)
            2. Arrivals expect vectors (choose one: ILS, Visual) Runway (#) approach
            3. Departures expect runways (#, #, #)
            4. Notices to Airmen: PIREP; Closures; Birds; Noise abatement, MU readings Wind shear;
            SIGMET; HIWAS; Braking action; SWAP.
            5. For Clearance Delivery contact (position name) on frequency (frequency)
            6. VFR aircraft say direction of flight, aircraft type and requested altitude
            7. Pilots readback all runway hold short and taxi instructions.
            8. Advise on initial contact you have information (code). 
            
            >NOTE -- When ORD is landing converging runways or simultaneous approaches, place a message in the voice ATIS advising of converging operations to converging runways in use and/or that simultaneous approaches are in use. Also, when LAHSO operations are in effect, place an appropriate message in the voice ATIS. 
            
            >NOTE -- Prior to broadcasting, review the pending ATIS to ensure accuracy and inform pilots via voice and text of the update information code being broadcast.
            
    3. **Hierarchy of Opening Positions**: The following is a suggestion as to the order in which positions will be opened/split in the event more than one controller wishes to control C90. All splits will be governed by the event parameters and may not occur as shown below. 
        1. ORD Approach/Departure Hierarchy

        3. Satellite positions can be opened and closed independent of ORD Approach/Departure positions.
        4. In the event satellite positions are not open, the feeder approaches for ORD will assume control over the satellite airspace within their delegated airspace unless an ORD Departure controller is online. 


### Chapter 3. O'Hare Approach Control
3. O'Hare Approach Control
    1. **ORD Approach Control Airspace**: Chicago TRACON Feeder controllers are delegated that airspace as depicted below. Defined airspace for each of the Feeder controllers is configuration specific and detailed in the graphic for each arrival configuration. Concerning runway 28L/10R, information in this chapter will be added in the update of this document that occurs after a scenery is made available with runway 28L/10R available for us. Any diagram below that had at one point included runway 32R/14L remains, however, the runway has been permanently closed and is no longer in use and therefore should be disregarded on the diagrams.
    ![C90 ORD Feeder Controller Airspace](https://i.gyazo.com/cdfcb3bbd79bc2b42674de1c00e63dab.png)
        1. ORD Finals are delegated that airspace within active descent areas as depicted in this chapter.
        2. Final shall not descend into the descent area until ensuring diverging or 3NM lateral separation exists from departure aircraft on ORD Tower assigned headings that parallel the descent area. 
        3. ORD Feeder boundaries are uncommon with ORD departures and South Satellite. Feeders may operate to airspace boundary. 
    2. **O'Hare Approach Control Positions**:
    
        Position Name | Frequency | Callsign | Voice Channel
        :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
        FARMM Feeder | 135.020 | CHI_Y_APP // CHI_Y1_APP | chi_y_app
        PLANO Feeder | 135.070 | CHI_X_APP // CHI_X1_APP | chi_X_app
        KUBBS Feeder | 125.700 | CHI_J_APP // CHI_J1_APP | chi_j_app
        OKK Feeder | 118.920 | CHI_E_APP //CHI_E1_APP | chi_e_app
        ORD North Final | 124.350 | CHI_F_APP // CHI_F1_APP | chi_f_app

        ORD Central Final | 119.00 | CHI_Z_APP CHI_Z1_APP | chi_z_app

    3. **Feeder Approach**:
        1. Feeder Approach shall accept handoffs from vZAU and adjacent facilities for ORD arrivals, initiate handoffs to the appropriate Feeder or Final position, and be responsible for initial control and sequence of aircraft to the active descent area. Feeders are expected to adjust speed, altitude, and interval to ensure appropriate in-trail spacing for Final Approach.
        2. Feeder Approach is also responsible for coordinating with adjacent facilities and C90 positions regarding any situation or condition that may impact ideal operation.
        3. Feeder Approach should feed aircraft to another feeder controller on a published arrival or assigned heading, that will enter the receiving controller’s airspace. Accomplish communication transfer and radar handoff. The receiving Feeder has control of the aircraft on contact, not upon entering airspace, unless otherwise coordinated.
        4. Feeder Approach should feed aircraft to Final Approach on a lead-in, downwind, or base heading, or a published arrival. Accomplish communication transfer and radar handoff as soon as possible. Final has control on contact, not upon entering airspace, unless otherwise coordinated. 
    4. **Final Approach**:
        1. Final Approach shall accept handoffs from Feeders, and/or adjacent facilities when appropriate, and provide final sequence to their primary runway, initiate handoffs to other Feeders or Finals.
        2. Final Approach is also responsible for coordinating with Local control regarding any situation or condition that may impact ideal operation including missed approaches that will remain inbound on the localizer. 
        3. Final Approach shall inform any aircraft when they exit and re-enter the Class Bravo airspace prior to handing the aircraft to Local Control. 
        4. When conducting simultaneous approaches to parallel runways, turns in the descent area should be no greater than 210kts. 
    5. **Simultaneous ILS/RNAV Approaches**: Simultaneous ILS/RNAV Approach procedures are to be utilized with such approaches are being conducted on two or more parallel runways. 
        1. For two runways, traffic vectored for the low side (27L, 22L, 4L) shall be at 4,000 ft. when joining the localizer at the 6,000 ft. fix on the ILS approach. Traffic vectored for the high side (28C/R, 22R, 4R) shall be at or above 5,000 feet when joining the localizer at the 6,000 foot fix on the ILS approach. 
        2. Traffic from the High and Wide Stream (SHAIN/WATSN/OXI STARs) will always be vectored for the high side when utilizing dual Simultaneous approaches. 
        3. In the event an aircraft should be pulled off the final for any reason, attempt to obtain visual separation between that aircraft and cancel the approach clearance. Assign the aircraft 3,000 ft., or if above, an altitude that ensures separation and does not conflict with downwind traffic. Coordinate with the appropriate controller for altitude, heading and speed with that aircraft. Point out the aircraft to any effected TRACON control position. 
    6. **Triple Simultaneous ILS/RNAV Approaches**: Simultaneous ILS/RNAV Approach procedures are to be utilized when such approaches are being conducted to three parallel runways, and capture points will be utilized. 
        1. Traffic vectored for Triple Simultaneous approaches shall be conducted at ORD utilizing only and east or west flow runway configuration. Aircraft should normally be established on final outside the defined capture point.  
        East Flow Capture Points:
        
            Runway | Altitude | Capture Point
            :---: | :---: | :---:
            9L | 4,000 ft. | 6,000 ft. FIX
            9R | AOA 7,000 ft. | 8,000 ft. FIX
            10L | 5,000 ft. | 7,000 ft. FIX
            || 6,000 ft. | 8,000 ft. FIX
            10C | 5,000 ft. | 7,000 ft. FIX
            || 6,000 ft. | 8,000 ft. FIX
        
        2. Traffic may be turned onto final inside the Capture Point if no parallel traffic exists and prior coordination is affected. 
        3. Traffic vectored for the low side (North) shall be at 4,000 feet prior to 3NM from the Central localizer.
        4. Traffic vectored for the middle side (South) must be established on final at 5,000 feet, at the defined capture points. Aircraft must be level at the intercept altitude prior to 3NM from the Central localizer if traffic is inbound on the parallel runway final approach course. 
        5. Traffic vectored for the Central localizer shall cross WASCO (9R) or GRABL (27L) at 7,000 feet, unless otherwise coordinated. 
        6. In the event an aircraft should be pulled off the final of the central localizer runway for any reason, attempt to obtain visual separation between that aircraft and cancel the approach clearance. Instruct the aircraft to climb and maintain 4,000 feet and track the localizer, or issue the localizer heading if unable to track. Coordinate with the appropriate departure controller and initiate a handoff if necessary. 
    7. **Dual Parallel Visual Approaches**: Weather must be a ceiling of 4,500 feet or higher, and visibility of 10 miles or greater for use as the primary approach procedure.
        1. Traffic vectored for the low side shall be issued, and have acknowledged, a visual approach clearance prior to 3NM of the high side localizer unless visual or vertical separation is being applied with parallel runway traffic. 
        2. Traffic vectored for the high side shall not be descended below 5,000 feet until established on the localizer or cleared for a visual approach. With coordination, the high side may run visual approaches and the low side may run ILS approaches.
    8. **Triple Parallel Visual Approaches**: Triple Parallel Visual Approaches are not operated at O’Hare. Up to two parallel runways, the outboard runways, may be utilized for visual approaches while a third, the center runway, must be primarily an ILS approach. 
        1. The one exception to having three runways operating visual approaches constitutes that the Center final shall primarily conduct ILS approaches. Individual aircraft, however, may be cleared for a visual approach to the center runway provided the pilot is instructed to fly the localizer. 
        2. When visual approaches are being conducted to one runway and ILS approaches are being conducted to two runways, weather must be a ceiling of 4,500 feet or higher, and visibility 10 miles or greater for use as the primary approach procedure.
        3. When visual approaches are being conducted to two runways and ILS approaches are being conducted to one runway, weather must be a ceiling of 5,500 feet or higher, and visibility 10 miles or greater for use as the primary approach procedure. 
    9. **Configuration Changes**: When the weather is greater than a ceiling of 4,500 feet and greater than a visibility of 10 miles, traffic shall be no closer than a 10NM final from traffic that is touching down on an opposite direction final. When the weather is less that stated, traffic shall be no closer than a 16NM final from traffic that is touching down on an opposite direction final. 
    10. **4's A Pair Single/Parallel/Visual/ILS/LOC Approaches**:
        1. Traffic Patterns and Split Operations: 4L Low side, 4R High Side

        2. If the receiving controller accepts the point out, the initiating controller shall issue as part of the cancellation procedure to report cancellation on the receiving controller’s frequency. Even though no communication transfer has been made it is the responsibility of the receiving controller to ensure the cancellation of IFR by the aircraft. 
    2. **Uncontrolled Satellite Airport Instrument Approach Restrictions**: Whether the aircraft will transfer from one sector to another, it is the responsibility of the initiating controller to ensure the aircraft does not breach the vertical or lateral limits of the satellite airspace while flying the approach procedure. 
        1. If the pilot is unable to abide by the following restrictions, coordination with the affected position may be made based on controller workload. 


### Chapter 8. Position Relief
8. Position Relief
    1. **Relief Restrictions**: Critically dependent positions must not be simultaneously relieved. In this case, a second position may not be relieved until after the first is complete and transfer of control has been confirmed. 
    2. **Relief Procedures**: These procedures shall apply at all positions utilizing radio capabilities, acting in handoff duties for radio positions or working in the split mode for a radio position. 
        1. The relieving controller shall observe the position for a period of time including the operational situation and listening to voice communications. The relieving controller shall indicate when he/she is ready to be briefed on the position being relieved. The relieving controller may ask any questions necessary to ensure a complete understanding of the operational situation after the verbal briefing is complete. 
        2. The controller being relieved shall commence the verbal briefing at the request of the relieving controller. The relief checklist should be followed by the active controller. Any abnormal traffic should be pointed out to the relieving controller. After the checklist has been completed and all questions have been answered, the active controller may release the position. The now-inactive controller shall remain on the frequency for a period of time to ensure the position has been
successfully transferred.
        3. At the point in which the transfer is complete, the relieving controller, now-active-controller shall make a statement or otherwise indicate to the now-inactive-controller that position responsibility has been assumed. 
        4. When both parties agree that the relieving controller has assumed responsibility, they must end coordination communication with their operating initials. 
    3. **Relief Checklist Order**: When transferring a position to a relieving controller, the following items shall be communicated verbally as part of this checklist and in the following order: 
        1. Runway Configuration at all noteworthy airports
